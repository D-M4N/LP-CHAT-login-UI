// 1 ADD FIRE BASE SDK

//Use npm

//Use a <script> tag
//If you're already using NPM and a module bundler such as webpack or Rollup, 
//you can run the following command to install the latest SDK (Learn more):

npm install firebase

//Then, initialise Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products that you'd like to use.

// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCXImSzbJhdzmVkcMzZc8LgN9EDaCH6WUw",
  authDomain: "lowpro-chat.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "lowpro-chat",
  storageBucket: "lowpro-chat.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "401818287275",
  appId: "1:401818287275:web:2d2e236e4c9d94a3cc0bee",
  measurementId: "G-BB1WMBCHER"
};

// 2 Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);


//ADD FIRE BASE CLI

//To host your site with Firebase Hosting, you need the Firebase CLI (a command line tool).
//Run the following npm command to install the CLI or update to the latest CLI version.

npm install -g firebase-tools

//Doesn't work? Take a look at the Firebase CLI reference or change your npm permissions




// 3 DEPLOY TO FIREBASE HOSTING

//You can deploy now or later. 
//To deploy now, open a terminal window, 
//then navigate to or create a root directory for your web app.
//Sign in to Google

firebase login


//Initiate your project
//Run this command from your app's root directory:

firebase init


//When you're ready, deploy your web app
//Put your static files (e.g. 
//HTML, CSS, JS) in your app's 
//deploy directory (the default is 'public'). 
//Then, run this command from your app's root directory:

firebase deploy


//After deploying, view your app at lowpro-chat.web.app
